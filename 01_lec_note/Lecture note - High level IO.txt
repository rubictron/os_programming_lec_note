//fp is a pointer to a structure called FILE. If file cannot be opened, 
fp is pointed to NULL. If it is successful returns an integer.
fopen() is used. F
irst argument is name of the file. 
Second argument is mode. Mode can be,
'r' - Open fie for Reading
'w' - Open file for Writing. If file already exists, 
      the content will be deleted. If file does not exists, 
      new file will be created
'a' - Open file for writing. If file exists previous 
      content will not be deleted, If file does not exists, 
      new file will be created

When a C program is started, the operating system environment is 
responsible for opening three files and providing pointers for them. 
These files are the standard input, the standard output, 
and the standard error; the corresponding file pointers are called 
stdin, stdout, and stderr, and are declared in <stdio.h>. 
Normally stdin is connected to the keyboard and
stdout and stderr are connected to the screen, but stdin and stdout 
may be redirected to files or pipes

fprintf returns an integer upon success.

fscanf() reads word by word from a file. 
It returns EOF at the end of the file. It returns 1 upon successful 
fetching of a word.
