1. Use shared memory to transfer the message "message from parent P1" from parent process to child process C1. C1 has a Child C2. 
When message from P1 is received to C1; C1 will respond P1 with "response from child C1". At the same time C1 must send "message from parent C1"
to C2. When C2 receives that message, it should respond to C1 with "response from child". P1 and C1 must exit after responses from child are heard.
C2 must terminate after sending response to C1?
