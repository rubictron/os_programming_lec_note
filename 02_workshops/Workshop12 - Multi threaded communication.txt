1. Write a program to create two threads. one thread runs a function which increments a process scope global variable 10 million times and
the other thread must decrement it 10 million times. At last main thread must return the value of global variable?

2. Modify the above program with concurrency control using Mutex to provide correct result?

3. Create a hyper-threaded process with 2 simultaneous threads. one thread should write as "Thread1" repeatedly 30 times and the other
 thread should write as "thread2" repeatedly 30 times. When thread1 executes, it should print the word "Thread1" 10 times and wait
 until the other thead prints "Thread2" 5 times before thread1 prints again. Use Mutex and condition variables for this program?

4. Use 5 hyper threads(T1,T2,T3,T4,T5) to print "Thread1 ", "Thread2 " by each thread to console concurrently along with thread ID.
Assume each thread consumes a constant time of 1 ms to print a word?
