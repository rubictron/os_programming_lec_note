1. A process contains a global integer variable known as data_v initialized to 100 which store in data segment. 
Process is having a local integer variable in main function as stack_v = 1000. It stores an integer variable heap_v=10000 in Heap.
Now, a new child process is created and parent is suspended for 1s allowing time for the child to terminate. 
The child process's heap_v is changed to 20000, stack_v is changed to 2000 and data_v is changed to 200. 
Each process must print its data_v and stack_v values when each of them executes along with process ID. The child should print first?

2. Create a pipe to transfer the message "message from parent" from parent process to child process and display using terminal in child process?

3. Create a bidirectional communication channel using pipes to transfer the message "message from parent" from parent process to child process,
response message "response from child" from child process to parent process and display using terminal?
