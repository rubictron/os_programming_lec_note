1. Create a message que and send the following messages to the queue and create 2 Child processes C1 and C2 where C1 is the child of initial 
process and C2 is the child of C1. The initial process(P1) must send the following messages to the queue and wait until the first child 
process(C1) terminates.
 
   Type           Text
   100			  first message
   200            second message
   300			  third message
   100            fourth message
   200            fifth message
   100            sixth message
   300            seventh message
   150            eighth message
 
The first child process must read and print first 3 messages of que in FIFO manner and print to terminal along with process ID.
Then, the first child process will wait until the second child process reads next 4 messages in ascending order of type of messages. Then, 
second child must terminate after printing the 4 messages it read. Then, child 1 must also terminate. After that the initial process must 
read the message with type 300 and it should terminate after printing the read message with process ID?
